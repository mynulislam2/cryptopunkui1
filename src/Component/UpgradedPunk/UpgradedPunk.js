                    <span>OG Pioneer's</span> that have been with us since the original ERC-1155
                    contract will need to swap their old <span>ERC-1155 Crypt3d Punk NFT(s)</span>
                    for the new <span>ERC-721 Crypt3d Punk NFT(s).</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new ERC-721 Punk will be the <span>exact Punk that you
                        originally minted</span> , complete with
                    all their Punky Attributes. You may also find that
                    when your new, upgraded ERC-721 Punk arrives in your new wallet, that
                    it comes with a <span>free friend </span>- as our thank you
                    to you for sticking around with us through this transition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our new contract is keeping the Punks <span>soul bound </span>until the
                    <span>mint completes.</span>
                    This means that you won't be able to transfer your Punks out of your
                    wallet until the mint is over. We are doing this to counter any
                    nefarious activities that occur during Project mints, such as floor
                    crashing bots. As such, we <span>highly recommend</span> transferring all of your
                    OG Pioneer Crypt3d Punk NFT's into <span>one wallet </span> before doing the swap,
                    so they all land in the same, safe place, together, with their new <span>free friends</span> .
                </p>
                <p>This may all sound scary, but don't worry, it's super easy, just</p>

                    This will now show how many OG ERC-1155 Crypt3d Punks NFT you are about to swap.

                    This allows the contract to take your old, Manky, ERC-1155 Crypt3d

                    them for the new upgraded, shiny ERC-721 ones.
                    You will need to approve this transaction in your Web3 wallet.
